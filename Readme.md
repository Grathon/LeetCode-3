This is my personal repo while learning algorithms. There is NO GUARANTEE for opitimal solutions, so sometimes you might find a better one that what I post here (If so, I appreciate it that if you can post an issue).

# What's Leetcodeï¼Ÿ

> **LeetCode OJ** is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from an expanding library of hundreds of questions, code and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly.

You can visit [Leetcode Online Judge](https://leetcode.com/) for more information.

# Solution Table

Each file in this repo goes with a simple test, which use the example test testcase on LeetCode(or some cases made by myself). 

You may utilize my test code (`import _mytest`) to test the difference between your code and mine. 
- Time testing is supported by [line_profiler](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/line_profiler/) package.
- Unit testing is supported by [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) built-in library.

You may find that some problems are skipped, because I've planed to only cover easy and medium problems at first run. But don't worry, this is a long-term project. Just give me some time.
