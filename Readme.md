This is my personal repo while learning algorithms. There is NO GUARANTEE for opitimal solutions, so sometimes you might find a better one that what I post here (If so, I appreciate it that if you can post an issue).

# What's Leetcodeï¼Ÿ

> **LeetCode OJ** is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from an expanding library of hundreds of questions, code and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly.

You can visit [Leetcode Online Judge](https://leetcode.com/) for more information.

# Solution Table

Each file in this repo goes with a simple test, which use the example test testcase on LeetCode(or some cases made by myself). 

You may utilize my test code (`from _mytest import timetest`) to find the running time difference between your code and mine. Testing is powered by [line_profiler](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/line_profiler/) package.
